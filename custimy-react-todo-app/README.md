## Introduction

This is a simple To-do application built in ReactJS used as a starting point to show proficiency working in the frontend. 

## The task
This is an open-ended code challenge, the purpose is to show proficiency in ReactJS and creative thinking. 
You will create a new feature for this simple To-do application. 

It can be anything you seem worthy of building, e.g. implementing a due-date for the to-do tasks, an in-progress status, attaching files to a task etc.

There is no time-limit, but it is not expected you spend more than 5 hours on the project. 

Remember, the purpose is **not** to create a finished project, but to show proficiency in ReactJS, creating well structured resuable working code.  

Happy coding!
